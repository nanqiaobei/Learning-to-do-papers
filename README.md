# Learning to do papers aim:
*we want to learn analyse data and analyse experiment,learn to analyse method and experience to improve ourself,so in this project ,we collect some paper that fouces on analyse model,experiment or data  to gain some knowledge or some useful conclusion*<br/>

## 1.1Analysing model
*this section paper focuse on analysing model to find model disadvantage，and proprose new method to improve it*<br/>

## 1.2Analysing Data
*this section paper focuse on analysing data to find data new konwledge，and use new konwledge to improve task's effective*<br/>
**f1.ree lunch for few-shot learning:distribution calibration**  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06395.pdf)  [code](https://github.com/ShuoYang-1998/Few_Shot_Distribution_Calibration)


## 1.3Analysing Experiment
*this section paper focuse on analysing data to find data new konwledge，and use new konwledge to improve task's effective*<br/>
